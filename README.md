# Bing Menu
#### An Alexa Skill that can tell you the current menu of any of the four dining halls on the Binghamton University campus.

This Alexa Skill uses Node.js to scrape the menu from the Binghamton University menu website, and reads back the meal requested by the user at the dining hall requested by the user.

For example, a user may say:
"Alexa, ask Bing Menu what's for lunch at C4"

and Alexa would read the current lunch menu for the C4 dining hall.

The Invocation Model of the skill allows the user to ask many different variations of the above sentence without error.

This respository contains the main javascript file that handles the user's request and scrapes the menu data.
